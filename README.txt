Orb Legends - Prototype (Mobile-friendly)
========================================

Notes:
- This is a small HTML5 prototype (turn-based with optional Auto Fight behavior).
- I couldn't include copyrighted names; "7 Mystic Orbs" replaces "Dragon Balls".
- You can open index.html on your phone's browser to play immediately.
- If you want me to wrap this into an APK (webview) or add more features, tell me and I will explain options.

How to run on your phone:
1. Download the ZIP to your phone and unzip it.
2. Open the folder and tap index.html in your file manager / browser. Or upload the files to a simple web host (e.g., GitHub Pages) and open the URL.
3. The interface is touch-friendly. Use "Auto Fight" for automatic battles or Attack/Skill manually.

If you want an APK:
- I can prepare steps to wrap this into a simple Android WebView APK using tools like "WebViewGold" or by building with Android Studio / Cordova, but that requires either a cloud build service or someone with a PC to compile.
- Alternatively, I can provide instructions to publish via PWA (add to home screen) for near-native feel.
